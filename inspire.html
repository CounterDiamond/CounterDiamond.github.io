  <h1>I am inspired by <em>James Cameron</em></h1>
  <p><em>James Cameron</em> inspires me because rather than giving up on difficult ideas, he keeps working on them and allows time to sculpt them into better products.</p>
  <p>I find this powerful because if I keep working for what I want and keep building my skills there are no limits to what I can do</p>
