    <h1>Websites I Find Amusing</h1>
    <h3>by Eli Diamond</h3>
    <p>I generally watch videos on the internet, but these are some sites that I find fun to look at to pass time.</p>

    <h2>"Funny" Subreddit</h2>
    <p>This is a subreddit that I would spend countless hours on with some of my highschool friends during lunch and off blocks</p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/">r/funny</a>

    <h2>MemerMan on Youtube</h2>
    <p>Youtube is where I spend most of my time on the internet, and when I would like to pass time and not interested in watching car/technology related videos I watch MemerMan</p>

    <h2>Linus Tech Tips</h2>
    <p>Sometimes I like to feel as if I am being productive. In this case I usually enjoy waiting major tech related videos/podcasts on youtube because I am learning a bit about the tech world in which I am studying, but also finding it interesting.</p>
